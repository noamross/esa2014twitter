# Usage of twitter during the ESA2014 meeting

**A short note on method:** I (`tpoisot`) used the Twitter Search API to
get tweets with the hashtags `#ESA2014` and `#esa2014`, from Aug. 08 2014, to
Aug.16, 2014. Tweets were identified by their `id`. The file `data/tweets.json`
has all unique tweets recorded, in the format used by the twitter API.
